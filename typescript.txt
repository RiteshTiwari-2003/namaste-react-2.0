########  what is typescript why we use typescript in project , why it is beneifical ?

1. what is the typescript?

it is the super set of javascript , developed by microsoft that add statiuc typing in javascript.it allow developer o write most and robust , maintainable and scalable 
code by catching error at compile time instead of runtime , typescript code is gets compiled into a plain javascript code,which can run in any envoirment that support javascript (browser , nodejs)

##### why use typescript in project ?

1. static typing :

typescript introduce type (string , number , boolean ) that are not natively available  at javascript 
this help in catch error during compile time before run time like type error.

example: let age: number=20;
age="twenty-five";

2. improve developer experience :
typescript provide autocomplete , intellisence and better error detection in your code editor.
this leads to faster development and fewer mistakes.

3. better refectoring :
static typing makes it easier to refector code safely because the compiler can insure correctness

4. documentation :
types act as a documentation for youe code, you can understand what a function or component expects without diving into your code 

function add(a:number,b:number):number{
    return a+b;

}

5. support model javascript feature :
typescript support all the modern javascript feature (ES6/ES2020) and provide additional feature  like interfaces and decorator and generics 

6. integration with large project: 
typescript is particulerly use for large scale application where maintaining and scaling javascript code become difficult.

7. compatibility with javascript :
you can start using typescript in small portion of your project, since it is fully compatible javascript,all .js file are valid typescript file


#  why replace .js and .jsx files with .ts and .tsx in react?

1. type safety :
.tsx file add static typing to your react component , ensuring that props states and context are used correctly.

example of typed react component :
interface ButtonProps{
    label: string;
    onClick:()=>void;
}
const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps>=({label,onClick})=>(
    <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
)

#### how to setup typescript in project?

1. Using create react app:
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript

2. migrating an existing react project:
1. install typescript and type definition for react:
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom

2. rename .js file to .ts file and .jsx to .tsx file 

3. create a tsconfig.json file:
npx tsc --init


##### using vite :

npm create vite@latest my-app --template react-ts
cd my-app
npm install 
npm run dev
